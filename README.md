# Roc Group 8 Project

## Code styling

* Commits should follow [standard Git commit guidelines](http://git-scm.com/book/ch5-2.html#Commit-Guidelines).
  - Commits should fit in the sentence, “If applied, this commit will ___.”
* Code will be intended with tabs, not spaces.
* Opening curly braces will be on the same line as control structures (`if`, `switch`, `for`, `function`, etc.), separated with a space, and never on the next line.
* Function and variable names will be in camelCase.
* Constants will be in ALL_CAPS.
* Object types will be in UpperCamelCase.
* Operators will have spaces on both sides.
* Functions should have documentation strings.  For example:

```
/**
 * Adds two numbers.
 * @param {Number} a - The first number to be added
 * @param {Number} b - The second number to be added
 * @returns {Number} The sum of a and b
 */
function sum(a, b) { ... }
```
